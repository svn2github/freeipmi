FreeIPMI FAQ/documentation
--------------------------
- conman/powerman configuration (XXX)
  - in FAQ?

FreeIPMI general
----------------
- use switch instead of if/else if to improve performance
- oem extensions
  - test/check handle firmware versions
  - document firmware versions in docs/ or mans/?
- build system
  - single Makefile, so parallel build faster?
- consider moving #defines to #enums globally for easier debugging w/
  gdb
- event handling api/mechanism
- choose alternate port (XXX)
  - most notably for testing or port forwarding
  - maybe oddball case need fallback RMCP port
  - to maintain backwards compatability, implement in hostname
    i.e. "-h foonode:1282"

FreeIPMI new stuff
------------------
- ASF - maybe support base protocol stuff like rmcp?
- picmg hpm/hpmi.1 standard - defines ipmi firmware update stuff
  - http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/specifications.htm
- pmbus.org
  - doable via FreeIPMI?  Can pass through Smbus to PmBus to do power control monitoring?
- ipmi-seld
  - log sel events to syslog?
    - work across cluster, configure w/ range of hosts
    - need filtering thingie to remove messages you don't care about?
- server simulator
  - support testing at scale
  - test larger set of corner cases, possibilities, workarounds, etc. 
  - different SDR combos
  - different SEL entries
  - all permutations of sensors, etc.
- config tools for (***)
  - dcmi (***)
  - intel node manager (***)
  - firmware firewall
  - other config options in ipmi-oem
  - inventec mac/shared nic stuff
    - will reboot BMC, is big problem
- fru library like libipmimonitoring
- ipmi proxy
  - capture lan and do inband, maybe useful if you have dedicated port
  that can't be seen by the network, and you don't have enough switch
  ports to have both plugged up to the network.

library general
---------------
- merge all libs into one?  would aid debian packaging.
  - make package layout simpler?
  - make .so-naming consistent?
  - merge all except libipmidetect?

libfreeipmi
-----------
- forwarded command support (errata 35b)
- support serial interface?
- have funcs that return buflen return ssize_t?, input should be
  size_t and void *? like read(), write()?
- xRC4
  - on Quanta S99Q/Dell FS12-TY
  - Began on branches/xrc, from the branch ChangeLog
  - xRC has been dropped for the time being.  After researching xRC,
    ultimately the current architecture of all of FreeIPMI is
    ill-suited for it.  As a stream based encryption, too much
    architecture of FreeIPMI has been based on individual packets
    being sent/recved/encrypted/decrypted independently of each other.
    Most of xRC implementation is doable with some hacks.  For
    example, the initialization vector and data offsets could be
    passed as in/out parameters to the assemble/disassemble packet
    functions.  The Krc could be re-generated as needed if the
    initialization vector had been noticed to change (or data offset
    == 0).  However, the deal break was an "out-of-band" requirement
    for implementation of the suspend/resume payload encryption.  In
    particular, if a packet from the BMC that had a new initialization
    vector was dropped on the network, the client would need to send a
    "suspend/resume payload encryption" packet to tell the BMC to
    start over again before doing a resend. Architecturally, this was
    the part that would have been VERY difficult to implement across
    FreeIPMI as the client would suddenly be required to understand
    the assemble/disassemble subtleties underneath and send the packet
    on its own.

libfreeipmi-fiid
----------------
- rearch for speed to not use strings, use macros + strings in internal.  So something like:
  {1, FOO_MACRO, "FIELD_NAME", FLAGS}
  so avoid string compares for get/set/compare/etc., but have available for debug output.

libfreeipmi-driver
------------------
- ssif userspace implementation
  - see ipmiutil for example
- (NEVER TESTED) openipmi ipmb
  
libfreeipmi-api
---------------
--fail-if-ipmi-not-detected
  - would need inband flag - discover vs. not-discover on locate
  - Ultimately impossible to do correctly, vendor need not store
    anything in acpi/smbios/etc.
  - User can use ipmi-locate if they really want to probe?

libfreeipmi-interpret
---------------------
- handle sensor/sel events outside of spec - configurable in some way?
  - some vendors have extra bits not in spec
- handle sensor/sel events differently for different sensors on same
  motherboard
  - e.g.
  SENSORFAULT | State Deasserted
  SENSOROK    | State Asserted
  - need mechanism to specify record ids/sensor number/entity/generator?
- some sensor interpretations dependent on sensor number, way to add?
  - QSSCS4R SMI Timeout & Power Throttled sensors 
    - same event-type/sensor-type/etc., but different interpretation??  

libfreeipmi-sel-parse
---------------------
- use else if to improve performance
- split vendor files into motherboard files?  Is getting big.

libipmiconsole
--------------
- "learn" workarounds function - to figure out workaround flags for user support simultaneous SOL sessions
  - very hard, almost impossible to do?? 
- "check" function, to see if session currently running
- engine_submit() - try and move initialization/setup code into engine
  to reduce time spent in engine_submit(), this is the core loop used by
  conman and other console software.
- use conditional signals w/ garbage collector
  - should work, it's not like the poll loop from before
- implement flag to not issue deactivate payload on timeout errors (XXX)
  - basically, tell ipmiconsole to assume SOL session stolen, we do not
    want to deactivate the payload of the currently running stolen session
  - or, call payload activation status to determine if stolen and can
    see if should call deactivate payload or not.
 
libipmimonitoring
-----------------
- select sensors via sensor name?
  - deal w/ motherboards with slightly different SDRs
  - but some mobos have sensor name == each other, so what is the purpose?
  - would need to also add sensor number with it??
  - also to deal w/ probability SDR's change on some mobos

tools common
------------
- entity ids 0x41, 0x42, are "identical" to other entries
  - should map them together for --entity-id-names output in
    ipmi-sensors and ipmi-sel?
- hostrange exclude hosts option
  - not really necessary in FreeIPMI?  in pdsh, the reason you really
    need this is because you can do -a (all) or -g (genders
    attribute/netgroups attribute).
- if user inputs hostname of localhost, do inband not outofband?
- config via environment variables too - like config file?
- config file - support workarounds/etc. for heterogenous clusters
  - maybe?
  - workaround-flags BLAH hosts[1-3]
  -  workaround-flags FOO  hosts[5-9]
- read/store username/password/k_g out of file encrypted so it's not
  sitting there in the clear
  
ipmi-sensors
------------
- split vendor files into motherboard files?  Is getting big.
- option to check sensor thresholds manually instead of event bitmask
  - some mobos seem to set flags incorrectly
- column for sensor number?
  - useful for shared sensor output?
- how to select specific shared sensor on commad line, can't do normally (XXX)
  - i.e. perhaps need to do record-id and something else, like
    -r 5.2 to indicate record id 5 and offset 2.
  - issue for libipmimonitoring too?

ipmi-sel
--------
- binary search like mechanism to make --display faster
- support kernel panic OEM event 0xF0
  - can't make work, is just my motherboard?  Or perhaps specific panics, not test panics?
  - redhat doesn't enable by default, probably don't need to worry about this much
  - see http://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/IPMI_PANIC_STRING.html
  - see http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/compiling-linux-kernel-module.html
- ganglia plugin?
- nagios plugin?

ipmi-fru
--------
- write FRU data option
  - for OEM integrators
  - or should be in bmc-device?

bmc-device
--------
- set bmc global enables
  - really should be done by firmware or distro
  - or only as needed in ipmi-oem per vendor need?
- (NOT CONFIRMED) get auxiliary log status

ipmiconsole
-----------
- support other escape codes like w/ &D
- support F1-F12 suggested by user

config tools
------------
- collapse into one allmighty tool (***)
  - user must pick section
  - bmc, pef, sensor, chassis, all
  - makes more extensible in the future
    - oem, dcmi, intel node manager, system info, firmware firewall, etc.
  - --category option (bmc, sensors, chassis, pef, oem, dcmi, intel)
  - make tools prefix sections w/ appropriate prefixes to allow
    for checking of what sections should be used
    - i.e. BMC, CHASSIS, PEF, etc.
    - probably not, too much backwords compatability crap to handle.
      Also would make code ugly as hell to make all duplicate sections.
      should do database of what sections go to what categories

bmc-config
----------
- support ipv4 mapped ipv6 addresses?
  - until in spec, no point, maybe deal in ipmi-oem?

ipmi-chassis-config
-------------------
* conf.5 manpage
(NEVER TESTED) panel button config - need hardware w/ this
(NEVER TESTED) device instance selector

ipmi-pef-config
-----------
* conf.5 manpage

ipmi-sensors-config

FreeIPMI X.X.X has been released. It can be downloaded at:

http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/download.html

What is IPMI?

The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) specification
defines a set of interfaces for platform management.  It is
implemented by a large number of hardware manufacturers to support
system management on motherboards. The features of IPMI that most
users will be interested in are sensor monitoring (e.g. CPU
temperatures, fan speeds), remote power control, and serial-over-LAN
(SOL).

What is FreeIPMI?

FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on the
IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.  FreeIPMI provides tools and libraries
for users to access and read IPMI sensor readings, system event log
(SEL) entries, serial-over-LAN (SOL), remote power control functions,
field replaceable unit (FRU) device information, and more.  More
information about FreeIPMI can be found at the FreeIPMI webpage at:

http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/index.html
