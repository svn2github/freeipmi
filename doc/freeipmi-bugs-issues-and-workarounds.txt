FreeIPMI Bugs, Issues, and Workarounds

by 

Albert Chu
chu11@llnl.gov

These are some short descriptions of the bugs, issues, and (if
relevant) workarounds I've found and discovered while developing
FreeIPMI on various motherboards.  When it was documented (or I
remember them), the motherboards these issues were found on are also
documented.

This is mostly to document compliance issues I've discovered.  When I
talk to vendors and they say, "IPMI is 100% compliant, we don't know
what you're talking about.", well, here's this document :-) 

I have also listed a set of other issues that, while not compliance
issues, are either interpretation issues between multiple motherboards
or a poor choice of implementation that makes IPMI poorer to use.  I
have placed a label of [INTERPRETATION] or [IMPLEMENTATION] next to these
issues respectively.

Naturally the motherboards I have much more access to and am capable
of working on will probably have more issues discovered.  As I develop
FreeIPMI and know more about IPMI, I am more likely to find more
issues on the most recent motherboard I worked on.  Possible
bugs/compliance issues on newer motherboards may be masked by
workarounds added to earlier motherboards.

I have worked extensively on or had significant access to:

Intel SR870BR2/Tiger 2
Intel SR870BN4/Tiger 4
Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card
Sun X4140
Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II
Dell Poweredge R610
Dell Poweredge R710
Inventec 5442/Dell Xanadu III
Quanta S99Q/Dell FS12-TY
Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700
Supermicro X8DTG
Supermicro X8DTU

I have had some short term or partial access to the following:

Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional Edition)
Sun Fire 4100 with ILOM
Tyan S4811 with SMDC daughter card
Supermicro X6-DHR-1G with BMC2.0 daughter card
Supermicro X8DTH
MSI MS-91D2
Dell Poweredge 2900
Dell Poweredge 2950
Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X
Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN

The remaining motherboards (and subsequent bugs/issues/workarounds)
listed below are from interaction with users in the community and I
never personally accessed (atleast at the time of documentation of the
bug/workaround).

For the record, I have nothing against the companies and these issues.
I am just as prone to programming bugs as they are.  The IPMI
specification is gigantic and mistakes will happen.  I expect some
design decisions were made for time to release, cost, customer needs,
etc. too.  This documentation is more for historical purposes, people
searching for information, and to document the difficulty of
developing portable IPMI code.

----------------------
| Inband IPMI Issues |
----------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inband IPMI Issue #1:

  The SMBIOS/DMI tables do not properly indicate that KCS base address
  is IO instead of memory-mapped.

  Seen on: HP ProLiant DL145 G1

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to use
  memory-mapped IO.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------
| LAN Authentication Issues |
-----------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

LAN Authentication Issue #1:

  BMCs would not respond to retransmissions of a Get Session Challenge
  Request if a previous Get Session Challenge response was lost.

  Seen on: Intel SR870BN4/Tiger 4

  Resolution: Workaround added to send retransmitted Get Session
  Challenge requests from a different source port.

LAN Authentication Issue #2:

  The only authentication supported by the motherboard is an OEM
  specific authentication.  IPMI specification requires several
  non-OEM authentication mechanisms.

  Seen on: Undocumented Motherboard

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Undocumented motherboard was an early Supermicro motherboard
  with IPMI support, but I never documented which one (achu).

LAN Authentication Issue #3:

  The initial outbound sequence number on activate session response is
  off by one.  The activate session response packet is supposed to
  contain the initial outbound sequence number passed during the
  request.

  Seen on: Intel SE7520JR2 with National Semiconductor PC87431M mBMC,
  Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module (Professional
  Edition)

  Resolution: Initially, workaround was done to accept off by one
  sequence number.  Later when packet windows were implemented, the
  situation was automatically handled.

LAN Authentication Issue #4:

  The IPMI 2.0 packet responses for RAKP 2 have payload lengths that
  are off by 1 (i.e. an invalid length).

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to handle the
  invalid length.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro H8QME with
  SIMSO daughter card.

LAN Authentication Issue #5:

  Username capabilities and/or K_g status are not reported properly by
  the Get Authentication Capabilities response.

  Seen on: Asus P5M2, Asus P5MT-R, Asus S162-E4, Asus RX4, Sun Fire
  X4150, Sun Fire X4450, Intel SR1520ML, Intel X38ML

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to ignore
  flags in the Get Authentication Capabilities response.

LAN Authentication Issue #6:

  The IPMI_PRIVILEGE_LEVEL_HIGHEST_LEVEL flag does not work in the
  Open Session phase of IPMI 2.0 connections.  The Open Session
  response seems to simply return the privilege level passed in the
  request (i.e. the IPMI_PRIVILEGE_LEVEL_HIGHEST_LEVEL flag rather
  than the actual highest level privilege that can be used).

  Seen on: Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module
  (Professional Edition)

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to not pass
  IPMI_PRIVILEGE_LEVEL_HIGHEST_LEVEL and pass a specific privilege
  level.

LAN Authentication Issue #7:

  The username field is incorrectly padded during IPMI 2.0
  authentication, leading to invalid keys.

  Seen on: Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module
  (Professional Edition)

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to adjust the
  username when authenticating.

LAN Authentication Issue #8:

  When the authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128 and the password
  is greater than 16 bytes, the Intel BMC truncates the password to 16
  bytes when generating keys, leading to invalid keys.

  Seen on: Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module
  (Professional Edition)

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to adjust the
  password when authenticating.

LAN Authentication Issue #9:

  During the RAKP4 response, the integrity check value is incorrectly
  calculated based on the integrity algorithm instead of the
  authentication algorithm.

  Seen on: Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module
  (Professional Edition)

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to look for
  and handle this situation.

LAN Authentication Issue #10:

  During the RAKP3 request, the name_only_lookup field must be
  disabled.

  Seen on: Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server Management Module
  (Professional Edition)

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to disable
  the field.
  
LAN Authentication Issue #11:

  Cipher suite IDs are are attached to specific privilege levels
  rather than a maximum privilege level limit.  So you can only
  authenticate at the configured privilege level rather than a
  privilege level <= to it.

  Seen on: Undocumented Motherboard

  Resolution: By passing IPMI_PRIVILEGE_LEVEL_HIGHEST_LEVEL during the
  session establishment instead of the specific privilege level, the
  problem is avoided.

  Notes: Undocumented motherboard was an early Tyan motherboard with
  IPMI 2.0 support, but never documented which one (achu).

LAN Authentication Issue #12:

  During a RAKP2 response, the key exchange authentication code is the
  wrong length.

  Seen on: Sun Fire 4100 with ILOM

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to handle the
  invalid length.

LAN Authentication Issue #13:

  The remote BMC incorrectly calculates keys using the privilege
  specified in the open session stage rather than the privilege used
  during the RAKP1 stage.  This can be problematic if you specify
  IPMI_PRIVILEGE_LEVEL_HIGHEST_LEVEL during that stage instead of a
  real privilege level.

  Seen on: Sun Fire X4150, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro
  X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
  Relion 700, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta QSSC-S4R//Appro
  GB812X-CN

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to pass a
  specific privilege level instead of
  IPMI_PRIVILEGE_LEVEL_HIGHEST_LEVEL.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Inventec 5441/Dell
  Xanadu II.  Due to legacy, vendor reports will not fix on Intel
  S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700.

LAN Authentication Issue #14:

  Given specific configuration of IPMI 1.5 authentication types,
  certain user privileges are not specified correctly during Get
  Authentication Capabilities and a CCh = "Invalid data field in
  request" is returned during Activiate Session.

  Seen on: Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Inventec 5441/Dell
  Xanadu II.

LAN Authentication Issue #15:

  Disabling a specific cipher suite ID does not prohibit a user from
  continuing to use that cipher suite ID.

  Seen on: Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, MSI MS-91D2

  Resolution: None

LAN Authentication Issue #16:

  Cipher suites 0 fails to authenticate.  During the RAKP4
  communication, an integrity key is returned, when it in fact should
  be 0 length.

  Seen on: Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin
  Relion 700

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to ignore the
  non-zero length field.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro X8DTG,
  Supermicro X8DTU.

LAN Authentication Issue #17:

  Cipher suites 7 and 8 fail to establish a session.  It appears
  authentication codes are not returned for session packets, therefore
  packets are dropped as they are viewed as malformed.

  Seen on: Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro X8DTG,
  Supermicro X8DTU.

LAN Authentication Issue #18:

  Cipher suites 11 and 12 fail to establish a session.  Authentication
  codes appear to be incorrect.

  Seen on: Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro X8DTG,
  Supermicro X8DTU.

LAN Authentication Issue #19: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  When attempting to authenticate with a disabled Cipher Suite ID, a
  0Ah status ("Unauthorized role or privelege level requested.") is
  returned instead of 11h ("No Cipher Suite match with proposed
  security algorithms.").  The resulting error message is incorrect
  and confusing.

  Seen on: Supermicro X8DTG

  Resolution: None

LAN Authentication Issue #20: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  When attempting to authenticate with a disabled Cipher Suite ID, a
  12h status ("Illegal or Unrecognized parameter.") is returned
  instead of 11h ("No Cipher Suite match with proposed security
  algorithms.").  The resulting error message is incorrect and
  confusing.

  Seen on: MSI MS-91D2

  Resolution: None

LAN Authentication Issue #21:

  The tag bits for some of the cipher records are wrong.

  Seen on: Sun Fire 4100 with ILOM

  Resolution: Workaround added to parse unique cipher suite records.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------
| LAN Session Issues |
----------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

LAN Session Issue #1:

  There is no response from the IPMI close command if a RESET is
  executed.

  Seen on: Intel SR870BN4/Tiger 4

  Resolution: Workaround added to close session without waiting for
  response.

LAN Session Issue #2:

  After the IPMI session is brought up, packet responses return empty
  session IDs (i.e. 00000000h) to the client.

  Seen on: Tyan S2882 with m3289 BMC

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to accept
  empty session IDs.
  
  Notes: Problem is reported to be fixed in newer firmware for Tyan
  S2882 with m3289 BMC.

LAN Session Issue #3:

  When Per-Message Authentication is disabled, packet responses
  contain non-null authentication data (when it should in fact be
  null).

  Seen on: Dell PowerEdge 2850, Dell Poweredge SC1425

  Resolution: Workaround option added to verify unexpected non-null authentication codes as though they were expected.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Dell PowerEdge 2850,
  Dell Poweredge SC1425.

LAN Session Issue #4:

  The remote BMC will advertise that Per Message Authentication is
  disabled, but actually require it for the protocol. 

  Seen on: IBM eServer 325

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to use Per
  Message Authentication no matter what is advertised by the remote
  BMC.

  Notes: Differs from Session Issue #5 below in resolution.

LAN Session Issue #5:

  The remote BMC will advertise that Per Message Authentication is
  disabled, but actually require it for the protocol.

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card

  Resolution: Workaround added to notice this condition and re-enable
  Per Message Authentication.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro H8QME with
  SIMSO daughter card.

LAN Session Issue #6:

  Session sequence numbers have the wrong endian during IPMI 1.5
  sessions.

  Seen on: Sun Fire 4100 with ILOM

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to handle
  incorrect endian sequence numbers.

LAN Session Issue #7:

  IPMI 1.5 sessions are not supported, only IPMI 2.0 sessions are
  supported.

  Seen on: HP Proliant DL 145 server

  Resolution: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------
| SDR Issues |
--------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SDR Issue #1:

  The record count reported by a Get SDR Repository Info command is
  not consistent to the number of records that exist on the
  motherboard.

  Seen on: Fujitsu RX 100

  Resolution: Workaround added to recognize situation and adjust count.

SDR Issue #2:

  The record ID returned from a Get SDR Record command would be
  different from the record ID passed in.

  Seen on: Supermicro X6-DHR-1G with BMC2.0 daughter card

  Resolution: No resolution in FreeIPMI required.  Resolved in
  IPMItool with workaround to detect issue and use input record ID
  instead of output record ID.

SDR Issue #3:

  When reading a SDR record, sometimes records list an invalid excess
  number of bytes.  For example, the SDR record is 15 bytes long, but
  a record of length 20 is indicated.

  Seen on: HP Proliant DL585G7

  Resolution: Workaround added to adjust and handle the correct lenght
  of the record.

| Serial-Over-LAN Issues |
--------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #1:

  Serial breaks are not supported/do not work.

  Seen on: Undocumented Motherboard

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Undocumented motherboard was an early Tyan motherboard with
  IPMI support 2.0, but I never documented which one (achu).

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #2:

  SOL payload sizes are reported incorrectly.

  Seen on: Asus P5M2, Asus P5MT-R, Asus S162-E4, Asus RX4, Intel
  SR1520ML, Intel X38ML, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro
  X8DTH, Supermicro X8DTH-iF, Supermicro X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU,
  Quanta QSSC-S4R/Appro GB812X-CN, Intel S5500WBV/Penguin Relion 700

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to ignore
  payload size checks and assume reasonable maximums.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Inventec 5441/Dell
  Xanadu II.  Problem is reported to be fixed in newer firmware for
  Supermicro X8DTH-iF.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #3:

  A non-default SOL port is specified but not functional.

  Seen on: Asus P5M2, Asus P5MT-R

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to ignore the
  non-default port and assume the default SOL port is still used.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #4:

  The Get Channel Payload Support command is not supported.

  Seen on: Sun Fire 4100 with ILOM

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to skip this
  point in the SOL state machine.

  Notes: This command is optional in the IPMI spec, it is not optional
  if SOL is supported.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #5:

  SOL sessions are not deactivated after a Deactivate Payload request,
  despite the response indicating success.  This could lead to a loop
  that continually believes a SOL session is active, tries to
  deactivate it, believes it is deactivated, then checks again if it
  is active.

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card

  Resolution: Code added to error after a number of failed deactivations.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro H8QME with
  SIMSO daughter card.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #6:

  When a new IPMI session is started and steals the SOL session from a
  previous one, the initial SOL session is not given a "SOL is
  deactivating" flag in a "BMC to Remote Console" packet.  The initial
  IPMI session should eventually time out, but the closing is not
  clean.

  In some cases, the IPMI session may "stay alive" and it is only
  serial data that may time out, leading to a situation that may be
  very similar to Serial-Over-LAN Issue #8.

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card, Inventec
  5441/Dell Xanadu II, Inventec 5442/Dell Xanadu III, Dell Poweredge
  R610, Dell Poweredge R710, Quanta S99Q/Dell FS12-TY, Supermicro
  X8DTG, Supermicro X8DTU, Intel S2600JF/Appro 512X, Quanta
  QSSC-S4R//Appro GB812X-CN
 
  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro H8QME with
  SIMSO daughter card, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Inventec
  5442/Dell Xanadu III.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #7: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  During a reboot, SOL packets appear to be temporarily internally
  dropped, leading to large increases in sequence numbers once the SOL
  session is "re-connected".  While the SOL session is technically
  alive, the inability to predict/handle the sequence number jump
  makes the SOL session.

  Seen on: Tyan S4811 with SMDC daughter card

  Resolution: Code added to error after a number of consecutive
  invalid packets are received.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #8: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  After a reboot, the SOL session appears to "disconnect" from the
  motherboard's serial chip.  While the IPMI/SOL session is
  technically alive, and character data input from the user is
  accepted by the remote BMC, no character data is sent back from the
  remote motherboard.  The SOL session is subsequently useless.

  Seen on: Intel SR1520ML, Intel X38ML

  Resolution: The SOL session must be closed and restarted.  Code to
  implement "serial NUL pings" may aid software in detecting this
  situation more quickly.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #9:

  The Activate Payload requires the "BMC asserts CTS and DCD/DSR to
  baseboard upon activation" flag to be set.

  Seen on: Undocumented Motherboard

  Notes: Undocumented motherboard  is an Intel motherboard.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #10: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  If the remote system requires encryption, but the user attempts to
  connect without encryption, an error response other than "Cannot
  activate payload without encryption" is returned.

  Seen on: Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Inventec 5441/Dell
  Xanadu II.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #11:

  The Get Payload Activation Status command is not implemented
  correctly (the completion code CCh = "Invalid data field in request"
  is returned).

  Seen on: Supermicro X8SIL-F

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to skip this
  point in the SOL state machine.

  Notes: Problem is reported to be fixed in newer firmware for
  Supermicro X8SIL-F.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #12:

  The reported SOL port is specified w/ the wrong endian.

  Seen on: Supermicro X8DTH-iF

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to ignore the
  non-default port and assume the default SOL port is still used.

  Notes: Problem is reported to be fixed in newer firmware for
  Supermicro X8DTH-iF.

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #13:

  The Get Payload Activation Status command does not properly indicate
  if a previous SOL session was created.

  Seen on: Quanta S99Q/Dell FS12-TY

  Resolution: None

Serial-Over-LAN Issue #14:

  SOL appears to be allowed regardless of SOL being enabled / disabled
  or a user being enabled / disabled for SOL access.

  Seen on: MSI MS-91D2

  Resolution: None
 
Serial-Over-LAN Issue #15:

  The Activate / Deactivate Payload commands appear to require Admin
  privileges, regardless of how SOL support is configured.  The IPMI
  specification indicates privilege requirements for executing these
  commands depends on configuration.

  Seen on: MSI MS-91D2

  Resolution: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #1:

  BMC requires that a password must be passed to the Set User Password
  command even if you are just trying to enable/disable a user.

  Seen on: Sun X4140

  Resolution: Workaround added to detect this situation and retry with
  a dummy password.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #2:

  Users cannot be enabled/disabled via Set User Password.

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card

  Resolution: None

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro H8QME with
  SIMSO daughter card.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #6: [CONFIG-1]

  Default Channel configuration had a privilege limit of OEM even
  thought motherboard did not support an OEM privilege.  Attempts to
  modify sub-fields "piecemeal" within the Set Channel Access command
  fail a parameter out of range error (0xC9).

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro H8QME with
  SIMSO daughter card.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #7:

  Setting a channel privilege limit (e.g. LAN channel privilege limit)
  does not affect authentication and/or execution of IPMI commands.

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card, Inventec
  5441/Dell Xanadu II

  Resolution: None

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Supermicro H8QME with
  SIMSO daughter card.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #8: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  When commiting/writing large amounts of configuration data, some
  data does not get stored or written properly.  It appears that the
  BMC may lose data if overwhelmed with data written to the BMC.

  Seen on: Supermicro H8QME with SIMSO daughter card, Quanta S99Q/Dell
  FS12-TY

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to slow down
  writing of data.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #9:

  The ability to authenticate under standard IPMI 1.5 authentication
  types (i.e. MD5) OEM authentication to be enabled.

  Seen on: Tyan S4811 with SMDC daughter card

  Resolution: OEM authentication must be enabled in the BMC
  configuration.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #10: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  Get Username and Get User Payload commands fail with CCh = "Invalid
  data field in request" if a username was not set previously.

  Seen on: Sun X4140, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II

  Resolution: Workaround added to notify user to configure username
  first.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #11: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  User access parameters "Enable IPMI Msgs" and "Privilege Limit" are
  not changeable via Set User Access for some users.  The values are
  not changeable until a username has been set.

  Seen on: Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Supermicro X8DTH, Intel

  700, Supermicro X8DTH
  
  Resolution: None

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #14:

  ARP response configuration is not functional even though the BMC ARP
  is capable.

  Seen on: Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II, Dell Poweredge R610, Dell
  Poweredge R710

  Resolution: None

  Notes: This command is optional in the IPMI spec, it is not optional
  if ARP response is supported.  Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for
  Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu II.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #15:

  Setting a password using IPMI 2.0 extensions (i.e. up to 20 bytes in
  length) does not appear to work.

  Seen on: Undocumented Motherboard

  Resolution: User must configure password using IPMI 1.5 formatted
  payloads.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #16: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  User cannot be enabled/disabled until after a non-null password has
  been configured.

  Seen on: Dell Poweredge R610, Dell Poweredge R710

  Resolution: Workaround added to re-try enable/disable user after
  password set.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #17: [CONFIG-1]

  Default Authentication Type Enables configure several OEM
  authentications on.  However, the motherboard does not support these
  OEM authentications, and any "piecemeal" configuration of the
  remaining sub-fields results in a bad parameter completion code
  (0xCC).

  Seen on: Dell Poweredge R610, Dell Poweredge R710

  Resolution: Workaround added to notice this circumstance and attempt
  to configure fields simultaneously.

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #18:

BMC/IPMI Configuration Issue #21: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  Several configuration fields, most notably several SOL configuration
  fields, are stored in volatile memory rather than non-volatile
  memory.  These particular configuration fields were not required by
  IPMI to be stored in non-volatile memory, but ultimately is an issue
  b/c it requires users to reconfigure IPMI on every system boot.

  Notes: Confirmed fixed in newer firmware for Fujitsu RX300, Fujitsu
  RX300S2.

Sensors Issue #13: [INTERPRETATION] [IMPLEMENTATION]

  Sensors do not assert state bits (i.e. sensor event bitmask)
  consistently to indicate that a sensor is "doing good".  For
  example, for a "Power Supply" sensor, offset 00h (i.e. state 0 or
  bitmask 0x0001) indicates "Presence Detected".  On some motherboards
  this is considered to be the "good" result to see from a "Power Supply"
  sensor reading.  On some other motherboards, the motherboards have
  elected to not return any offset (i.e. no states set or bitmask
  0x0000) when the power supply is fine, electing to only return an
  offset when an actual failure occurs.

  Seen on: Various, this is a general issue.

  Resolution: None

Sensors Issue #14: [IMPLEMENTATION]

  Event only sensors are listed in the SDR using a full or compact SDR
  record.  Software is very likely to believe these are sensors that
  are readable, leading to non-optimal performance.

  Seen on: Various, this is a general issue.

  Resolution: None

Sensors Issue #15:

  SDR records for some sensors give conflicting information.  For
  example, a threshold based sensor lists an event/reading type code
  for a discrete sensor.  The analog data format indicates an
  analog/threshold based sensor, however no threshold limits for the
  sensor are listed in the SDR.  This can lead to software to make
  invalid assumptions of the type of sensor it is reading and how to
  handle it.

  This was discovered when FreeIPMI and IPMItool sensor output
  mismatched.  In FreeIPMI, ipmi-sensors would report discrete states
  (e.g. "At or Below (<=) Lower Non-Critical Threshold") without an
  actual sensor reading (e.g. 100 Watts).  In IPMItool, it would
  output the sensor reading (e.g. 100 Watts) but invalid/incorrect
  discrete states.

  IMO, a SDR record that indicates a threshold reading w/ a discrete
  event/reading type code is illegal.  While it is not explicitly
  stated in the IPMI specification, it's is very strongly implied.

  Seen on: HP Proliant DL380 G7, HP ProLiant ML310 G5

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to read the
  sensor reading if there are enough hints it may be available.

Sensors Issue #16:

  The analog data format lists 4 possible conditions: 00b = unsigned,
  01b = 1's complement, 10b = 2's complement, 11b = does not return
  analog reading.  This strongly suggests that any SDR entry that does
  not report an analog reading should set this field to 11b.  However,
  text below this section states, "If neither thresholds nor analog
  reading are provided, this field should be written as 00h."  Some
  vendors set this field to 00b for non-analog sensors, while others
  set it to 11b.

  Seen on: Various, this is a general issue.

  Resolution: None

Sensors Issue #17:

  Some sensors report that their sensor scanning is disabled, even
  though the sensor is actually not.

| DCMI Issues |
---------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DCMI Issue #1: [INTERPRETATION]

  The DCMI spec indicates a potential completion code for the "Get
  Power Limit" command as "No Set Power Limit" (0x80).  FreeIPMI
  originally interpreted this to mean the "Set Power Limit" command
  was not available.  Atleast one vendor interpreted this to mean "No
  Power Limit Set".  One can consider this an English interpretation
  issue of 'No set POWER LIMIT' vs. 'No SET POWER LIMIT' (i.e. is
  "set" a verb or part of a proper noun referencing the DCMI command).
  Confounding this issue is the fact that the example implementation
  in Intel's DCMItool implements the former, while the DCMI
  Conformance test suite implements the later.  In addition to this,
  with the later interpretation, it need not be an indication of an
  error, but rather a flag.  So the rest of the packet can be
  completely full of legitimate data.  

  Seen on: Various, this is a general issue.

  Resolution: Code added to handle both interpretations.

DCMI Issue #2: [INTERPRETATION]

  The DCMI 1.1 Specification includes new commands to set the asset
  tag and management controller identifier string.  The payload to
  write these strings is:

  Byte 1   - Group Extension (DCh)
  Byte 2   - Offset to Write
  Byte 3   - Bytes to Write (max 16)
  Byte 4-N - Data

  and the response is:

  Byte 1 - Completion Code
  Byte 2 - Group Extension (DCh)
  Byte 3 - Total Length Written

  The maximum size for both strings is listed at 64 bytes.

  In the spec, it is unclear how this payload is to be used.  It is
  unclear if the "Total Length Written" field is similar to a posix
  write, where <= the bytes passed in may be written.  Or is it an
  indication of the total length of bytes stored?  The management
  identifier string is stated to be NUL terminated, but the asset tag
  is not stated with this requirement.  

  Seen on: Various, this is a general issue.

  Resolution: Code assumes that all 64 bytes of the buffer must be
  overwritten everytime the string is modified.  This seems to be the
  safest approach.

Platform Event Trap Issue #1:

  Responses from a PET Acknowledge are invalid and malformed.  The
  payload is short by one byte (i.e. does not contain a completion
  code).

  Resolution: Workaround option added to inform software to accept
  malformed packets.

Misc IPMI Issue #2:

  The Get System Info Parameters command returns insufficient
  privilege level (0xD4) even though the privilege level is
  sufficient.

  Seen on: Supermicro X8DTL-3F

  The manufacturer ID specified by the motherboard was invalid
  (i.e. not a valid IANA Enterprise number).

[CONFIG-1]

To see a discussion on why this implementation is poor, please see
"Configuration tool callback design" in the freeipmi-design.txt
document.

[IMPLEMENTATION]

This is not an IPMI compliance issue, but rather a poor implementation
that gives the user a poor experience.

[INTERPRETATION]

This is not an IPMI compliance issue, but rather a interpretation
issue in the specification that has lead to multiple implementations
by vendors.

[SENSORS-1]

In all liklihood, these are all circumstances that the vendor wanted
to say "this sensor isn't available on this motherboard".  It is
ironic that there are so many error codes vendors are returning for
this circumstance.  It's also strange that so many vendors don't set
the "reading unavailable" bit when returning the Get Sensor Reading
command.  But I digress.

I get the impression vendors try to put the same SDR on multiple
motherboards, regardless of whether a motherboard can even have a
sensor reading/event represented by that SDR entry, leading to the
strange range of error codes.

The best thing vendors could do is have an SDR for each motherboard
that is actually legit.  The IPMI spec strongly suggests this as well:

"Sensor Data Records are data records that contain information about
the type and number of sensors in the platform ..." (1.7.7).

"The SDR Repository is intended to hold information indicating the set
of management controllers, sensors, and FRU Devices that is expected
to be in the system ... For example, suppose the baseboard had
connectors for five fans, but only the first four were supposed to be
populated.  The SDRs for the system would report four fan sensors ..."
