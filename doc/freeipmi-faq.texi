@section @acronym{IPMI} - Platform Management Standard

The @acronym{IPMI} specifications define standardized, abstracted interfaces to
the platform management subsystem.  @acronym{IPMI} includes the definition of
interfaces for extending platform management between the board within the
main chassis and between multiple chassis.

The term platform management is used to refer to the monitoring and
control functions that are built in to the platform hardware and
primarily used for the purpose of monitoring the health of the system
hardware.  This typically includes monitoring elements such as system
temperatures, voltages, fans, power supplies, bus errors, system
physical security, etc.  It includes automatic and manually driven
recovery capabilities such as local or remote system resets and power
on/off operations.  It includes the logging of abnormal or out-of-range
conditions for later examination and alerting where the platform
issues the alert without aid of run-time software.  Lastly it includes
inventory information that can help identify a failed hardware unit.

@section What is FreeIPMI?

FreeIPMI is a collection of Intelligent Platform Management
@acronym{IPMI} system software.  It provides in-band and out-of-band
software and a development library conforming to the Intelligent
Platform Management Interface (@acronym{IPMI} v1.5 and v2.0)
standards.  FreeIPMI also supports IPMI-related specifications such as
the Data Center Management Interface (DCMI) and Intel Node Manager.

@section How did FreeIPMI start?

In October 2003, California Digital Corp. (CDC) was contracted by
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for the assembly of
Thunder, a 1024 node Itanium2 cluster.  This led to software
developers from CDC and LLNL merging the IPMI software developed by
both organizations into FreeIPMI.

Anand Babu, Balamurugan and Ian Zimmerman at CDC contributed the
in-band KCS driver, ipmi-sensors, bmc-config, ipmi-sel, bmc-info, and
portions of libfreeipmi.  Albert Chu and Jim Garlick at LLNL
contributed ipmipower, bmc-watchdog, ipmiping, rmcpping, portions of
libfreeipmi, and ipmi support in Powerman.  In October 2004, FreeIPMI
0.1.0 was officially released.

Since the 0.1.0 release, Z Research developers have contributed
ipmi-chassis, ipmi-raw, ipmi-locate, and portions of ipmi-pef-config.
LLNL has contributed IPMI 2.0 support, hostrange support, ipmiconsole,
libipmiconsole, ipmidetect, ipmi-sensors-config, ipmi-chassis-config,
bmc-device, ipmi-oem, ipmi-dcmi, libipmimonitoring, and portions of
ipmi-pef-config.

(Note: The original FreeIPMI developers from California Digital
Corp. are now at Zresearch Inc.)

@section What operating systems does FreeIPMI run on?

FreeIPMI was originally developed on GNU/Linux.  It has been confirmed
to be built on most major GNU/Linux distributions such as Redhat,
Fedora, Suse, and Debian.  FreeIPMI has been ported and confirmed to
work on atleast FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, OpenSolaris, and Windows
via Cygwin.  We imagine it would build cleanly on other operating
systems.  If it doesn't, it should be easily portable to them.  Please
contact the maintainers on the @email{freeipmi-devel@@gnu.org} mailing
lists.

@section FreeIPMI vs OpenIPMI vs Ipmitool vs Ipmiutil

There are multiple implementations, APIs, interfaces, end user
requirements, etc. that one can choose when developing IPMI drivers,
libraries, and tools.  FreeIPMI has taken some different approaches
than other open-source projects.

The section below points out a number of the reasons why we feel
FreeIPMI is particularly special compared to the other projects.

The Ipmiutil project has a good chart describing many of the
differences between the projects:
@uref{http://ipmiutil.sourceforge.net/docs/ipmisw-compare.htm}.

@node What is special about FreeIPMI?, Does my system support IPMI?, FreeIPMI vs OpenIPMI vs Ipmitool vs Ipmiutil, Top
@section What is special about FreeIPMI?

In our eyes, there are several reasons why FreeIPMI is particularly special.

1) Support for HPC and large data centers

A number of features have been added into the tools to support HPC
and/or large data centers.  Much of this original support was added to
support the large cluster environments at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL).

Scalable parallel execution of many FreeIPMI tools (ipmi-sensors,
ipmi-sel, bmc-info, etc.) across a cluster is supported through
hostranged input and output.  For example:

@example
# > bmc-info -h "pwopr[0-5]" -u XXX -p XXX --get-device-id -C
----------------
pwopr[0-1,5]
----------------
Device ID             : 34
Device Revision       : 1
Device SDRs           : unsupported
Firmware Revision     : 1.0c
Device Available      : yes (normal operation)
IPMI Version          : 2.0
Sensor Device         : supported
SDR Repository Device : supported
SEL Device            : supported
FRU Inventory Device  : supported
IPMB Event Receiver   : unsupported
IPMB Event Generator  : unsupported
Bridge                : unsupported
Chassis Device        : supported
Manufacturer ID       : Peppercon AG (10437)
Product ID            : 4
Auxiliary Firmware Revision Information : 38420000h
----------------
pwopr[2-4]
----------------
Device ID             : 34
Device Revision       : 1
Device SDRs           : unsupported
Firmware Revision     : 1.17
Device Available      : yes (normal operation)
IPMI Version          : 2.0
Sensor Device         : supported
SDR Repository Device : supported
SEL Device            : supported
FRU Inventory Device  : supported
IPMB Event Receiver   : unsupported
IPMB Event Generator  : unsupported
Bridge                : unsupported
Chassis Device        : supported
Manufacturer ID       : Peppercon AG (10437)
Product ID            : 4
Auxiliary Firmware Revision Information : 38420000h
@end example

In the above example, its clear to see that pwopr[2-4] have different
firmware than pwopr[0-1,5].  More information about hostrange support
can be found in the document freeipmi-hostrange.txt
(@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/freeipmi-hostrange.txt}).

Ipmipower is capable of scaling to large nodes for cluster support and
is supported by Powerman
(@uref{http://code.google.com/p/powerman/}) for scalable power
management.  At LLNL, in conjunction with Powerman, ipmipower is used
for power control on clusters ranging from sizes of 4 to 2000.  It has
been used to determine power status or power control LLNL's largest
clusters in under a second.

Ipmiconsole is currently supported by Conman
(@uref{http://conman.googlecode.com/}) for scalable console management.

Ipmi-sensors and libipmimonitoring are capable of interpreting sensor
readings as well as just reporting them.  It can be used for host
monitoring IPMI sensor severity on a cluster.  By mapping sensor
readings into NOMINAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL states, it makes
monitoring sensors easier across large numbers of nodes.  Skummee
(@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/skummee}) currently uses
libipmimonitoring to monitoring sensors on LLNL clusters of up to 2000
nodes in size.  FreeIPMI sensor monitoring plugins
for Ganglia 
(@uref{http://ganglia.info/}) 
and Nagios 
(@uref{http://www.nagios.org/}) 
have also been developed and made available for download
(@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/download.html}).

Ipmi-sel and libipmimonitoring are capable of interpreting system
event log (SEL) entries as well as just reporting them.  It can be
used for host monitoring IPMI event severity on a cluster.  By mapping
events into NOMINAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL states, it makes monitoring
system events easier across large numbers of nodes.  Skummee
(@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/skummee}) currently uses
libipmimonitoring to monitoring the SEL on LLNL clusters of up to 2000
nodes in size.

The bmc-config, ipmi-chassis-config, ipmi-pef-config,
ipmi-sensors-config, and configuration file and command-line interface
are used to easily copy the BMC configuration from one node to every
other node in a cluster quickly.  It has been used to modify the BMC
configuration across large LLNL clusters in a few minutes.  They also
have the capability to verify (via the diff option) that the desired
configuration has been properly stored to firmware.

Ipmidetect can be used to enhance the efficiency of the hostranged
input by eliminating those nodes in the cluster that have been
temporarily removed for servicing.

2) Additional OEM support

FreeIPMI contains support for a number of OEM extensions and OEM
sensors and/or events.  Ipmi-oem currently supports OEM command
extensions for motherboards made by Dell, Fujitsu, IBM, Intel,
Inventec, Quanta, Sun Microsystems, and Supermicro.  Ipmi-sensors and
Ipmi-sel support OEM sensors and/or events for motherboards made from
Dell, Fujitsu, Intel, Inventec, Quanta, Sun Microsystems, and
Supermicro.  (Some of the motherboards may have been rebranded by
vendors, see manpages for official list of confirmed supported
motherboards.)

3) Additional flexibility and features

By implementing various IPMI sub-sections into multiple tools, each
tool is capable of providing the user with more flexibility and
ultimately more features in addition to those listed above.  It may
not be as easy (or architecturally possible) to do in an all-in-one
tool.  

4) Extra IPMI support

In addition to the features listed above, FreeIPMI also supports
specifications related to IPMI.  The Data Center Management Interface,
or DCMI, is supported via the FreeIPMI tool ipmi-dcmi.  Some aspects
of the Intel Power Node Manager are supported in ipmi-oem.

5) Easy setup

By implementing drivers in userspace libraries, there is no need to
build/setup/manage any kernel modules/drivers.

6) Portability

Likewise, by implementing everything in userspace libraries and tools,
portability to multiple operating systems and architectures should be
easier.

@node Does my system support IPMI?, How do I compile FreeIPMI?, What is special about FreeIPMI?, Top
@section Does my system support IPMI?

Unfortunately, there are no universally defined mechanisms for
determining if a system supports IPMI.  The following may provide
hints.

1) FreeIPMI's ipmi-locate can be used to determine if IPMI can be
found on your system.  Users are cautioned though, the failure to
discover IPMI via ipmi-locate is not sufficient to disprove that IPMI
exists on your system.  Your system may not publish such information
or may expect clients to communicate at default locations.

2) dmidecode may be similarly used to probe for devices that support
IPMI on your system.  You may grep for IPMI or specifying the IPMI DMI
type on the command line.

@example
# > dmidecode --type 38
# dmidecode 2.10
SMBIOS 2.5 present.

Handle 0x0049, DMI type 38, 18 bytes
IPMI Device Information
        Interface Type: KCS (Keyboard Control Style)
        Specification Version: 2.0
        I2C Slave Address: 0x10
        NV Storage Device: Not Present
        Base Address: 0x0000000000000CA2 (I/O)
        Register Spacing: Successive Byte Boundaries
@end example

Again, the failure to find an IPMI supported device is not sufficient
to show lack of IPMI support.

Ultimately, some amount of information from product documents or trial
and error may be necessary to determine if IPMI is supported on your
system.

@node How do I compile FreeIPMI?, libgcrypt requirement, Does my system support IPMI?, Top
@section How do I compile FreeIPMI?

Please see the README.build instructions provided with FreeIPMI or on
the FreeIPMI website's documentation (@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/README.build}).

@node libgcrypt requirement, x86-64 Compilation, How do I compile FreeIPMI?, Top
@section libgcrypt requirement

FreeIPMI requires the libgcrypt library to be installed for a variety
of encryption requirements in IPMI 2.0.  If you are building FreeIPMI
and receive a 'libgcrypt required to build libfreeipmi' error, please
install libgcrypt.  For Linux users, this may require the install of
the libgcrypt-devel package as well.  For those who do not need IPMI
2.0 encryption, FreeIPMI may be built without it by specifying
--without-encryption when executing configure.

@node x86-64 Compilation, Installing FreeIPMI on FreeBSD, libgcrypt requirement, Top
@section x86-64 Compilation

By default, FreeIPMI's build autotools (e.g. configure) should detect
if you are on a 64 bit system and should build against 64 bit
libraries.  However, some multi-architecture installs (e.g. you have
32 bit and 64 bit libraries installed) may lead to builds and installs
of 32 bit instead of 64 bit.  For those noticing this, pass libdir
appropriately to the configure script to workaround this
problem. (e.g. --libdir=/usr/lib64)

Example:
@example
  # ./configure  --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64
@end example

@node Installing FreeIPMI on FreeBSD, What are some IPMI terminology or acronyms I should be aware of?, x86-64 Compilation, Top
@section Installing FreeIPMI on FreeBSD

You can install a binary package of freeipmi or use the port,
located in ports/sysutils/freeipmi, to build it from the source. See
ports(7) and 'Packages and Ports' section
(@uref{http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html})
in The FreeBSD Handbook.

Please contact port maintainer (MAINTAINER line in the port's Makefile),
if you have problems building from the port.

@node What are some IPMI terminology or acronyms I should be aware of?, What setup is needed for FreeIPMI to communicate over LAN?, Installing FreeIPMI on FreeBSD, Top 
@section What are some IPMI terminology or acronyms I should be aware of?

Good question, here are some terms and acronyms with general definition you might want to know.

@strong{BMC} stands for @strong{Baseboard Management Controller}.  The BMC
is the management chip on the system that is responsible for IPMI.  It
is common to refer to configuring the ``BMC'' as synonymous for
configuring IPMI.

@strong{inband} IPMI communication refers to communication on a system
locally (i.e. not over a network).

@strong{outofband} and @strong{IPMI over LAN} refer to IPMI
communication over a network, typically ethernet.

@strong{SDR} stands for @strong{Sensor Data Repository}.  The SDR is a
database of system information that is needed by many other IPMI
functions.  It is commonly read before some IPMI action can be taken.
For example, it contains a list of all sensors on a system, so it
must be downloaded before sensors on a system can be read.  In
FreeIPMI, the SDR is cached in a common location and can be used by a
number of tools, such as ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sel, and ipmi-fru.

@strong{SEL} stands for @strong{System Event Log}.  The SEL is a log of
events stored on the system for later diagnostics.  In FreeIPMI,
ipmi-sel can be used to read the SEL.

@strong{FRU} stands for @strong{Field Replaceable Unit}.  While FRU is
a general computing term refering to a replaceable unit of
electronics, in IPMI is is common to refer to the ``FRU'' as the
database of all FRU components on a system.  In FreeIPMI,
ipmi-fru can be used to read the FRU components on a system.

@strong{PEF} stands for @strong{Platform Event Filtering}.  PEF refers
to the rules that determine when PETs are generated and where they are
sent.  In FreeIPMI, PEF can be configured via ipmi-pef-config.

@strong{PET} stands for @strong{Platform Event Trap}.  PET refers to a
trap that can be sent by a system to an SNMP agent to indicate an
event has occurred on the system.  In FreeIPMI, a PET trap can be
interpreted via ipmi-pet.

@strong{DCMI} stands for @strong{Data Center Management Interface}.
DCMI is a management interface defined by a group of vendors that use
IPMI as the backend for their system management definition.  In
FreeIPMI, ipmi-dcmi can be used to read/configuring DCMI.

@strong{SOL} stands for @strong{Serial over LAN}.  SOL refers to the
forwarding of serial system traffic over a network, typically an
ethernet network.  It is typically used to access a remote system
console.  In FreeIPMI, ipmiconsole is used to access a remote console
via SOL.

@strong{RMCP} stands for @strong{Remote Management Control Protocol}.
The RMCP protocol is another remote management protocol which IPMI is
defined within for outofband communication.  For most IPMI users, you
will never need to know about RMCP.

@node What setup is needed for FreeIPMI to communicate over LAN?, What setup is needed for Serial over LAN (SOL) or Ipmiconsole?, What are some IPMI terminology or acronyms I should be aware of?, Top
@section What setup is needed for FreeIPMI to communicate over LAN?

Please see the bmc-config.conf(5) manpage provided with FreeIPMI for
details, or you can read it on the FreeIPMI website's documentation
(@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/manpages/man5/bmc-config.conf.5.html}).

@node What setup is needed for Serial over LAN (SOL) or Ipmiconsole?, Do I need to install or configure a driver to perform IPMI inband?, What setup is needed for FreeIPMI to communicate over LAN?, Top
@section What setup is needed for Serial over LAN (SOL) or Ipmiconsole?

The setup of Serial-over-LAN (SOL) and/or Ipmiconsole is highly dependent on your system.  However, most motherboardss
require the following:

1) Adjust the BIOS COM port for serial redirection over SOL instead of
the normal serial port and set the appropriate baud rate.  If you do
not know which port is the SOL port, you may need to play around and
guess.  It is likely a non-default setting, since many manufacturers
may still assume the default redirection is out of the normal serial
port.  If you do not have a serial port on your motherboard, this part
can probably be skipped.

2) Configure IPMI on the motherboard to use SOL.  Many motherboards
may have this enabled by default, however you may wish to verify with
FreeIPMI's bmc-config.  More information can be found in the
bmc-config.conf(5) manpage on the settings.  However, the key settings
are to enable SOL on the system, enable SOL for individual users, and
select the appropriate baud.  On many motherboards, the selected baud
must match what is configured in the BIOS.

3) Adjust your operating systems serial console settings to use the
appropriate COM port.  For Linux, the following guide
(@uref{http://www.vanemery.com/Linux/Serial/serial-console.html})
provides a pretty good overview of setting of a serial console on
Linux.  The only difference for setting up a serial console with
Ipmiconsole or SOL, is the ttySX terminal may need to be changed.

@node Do I need to install or configure a driver to perform IPMI inband?, SSIF Driver Configuration, What setup is needed for Serial over LAN (SOL) or Ipmiconsole?, Top 
@section Do I need to install or configure a driver to perform IPMI inband?

For most people the answer is no.

FreeIPMI includes a userspace driver that works on most motherboards without any driver installation, loading, or configuration required.  FreeIPMI also includes support of a Linux SSIF driver through the SSIF device (i.e. /dev/i2c-0), the OpenIPMI Linux kernel driver (i.e. /dev/ipmi0), and the Sun/Solaris BMC driver (i.e. /dev/bmc).  If you communicate through one of these mechanisms, the appropriate drivers for them should be loaded.  Most systems should automatically load the appropriate drivers you need.  

Under most scenarios, the FreeIPMI tools should automatically discover which in-band interface to use and the proper settings to use.  Some motherboards may require you to determine alternate configurations for addresses, paths, etc. on your own and pass them as command line options to the tools.

Every system is different and your situation may differ.  Please see your manufacturer and operating system instructions.  

There are some additional Linux OpenIPMI kernel driver notes here: @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/README.openipmi}.

@node SSIF Driver Configuration, How do you setup Powerman with ipmipower?, Do I need to install or configure a driver to perform IPMI inband?, Top
@section SSIF Driver Configuration

FreeIPMI's SSIF driver works on top of kernel'2 i2c device
interface.

Under GNU/Linux load these kernel modules: i2c-dev, i2c-i801, i2c-core
before using FreeIPMI.

To identify SSIF device address: 

Example:
@example
$> lspci  (in the output look for this entry)
 00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corp. 6300ESB SMBus Controller (rev 01)
       Subsystem: Intel Corp.: Unknown device 342f
       Flags: medium devsel,  IRQ 17
       I/O ports at 0400 [size=32]
                    ----
$> cat /proc/bus/i2c
i2c-0   smbus    SMBus I801 adapter at 0400         Non-I2C SMBus adapter
                                       ----
    Make sure the "0400" above matches with the "0400" address under
    proc.  Also make sure "i2c-0" is not different. If it appears
    different then grep for "i2c-0" in this code "ipmitool.c" and
    change. "i2c-X" is the label assigned to each slave device attached on
    the i2c bus.

BMC address Locator:
    Refer to the SM BIOS IPMI Device Information Record
    Type 38,  record 06h and 08h. Use the value of record
    06h as the IPMBAddress and load the SMBus controller
    driver at the address value read from record 08h.

    Usual values for record 06h -> 0x42
    Usual values for record 08h -> 0x400
@end example

@node How do you setup Powerman with ipmipower?, How do you setup Conman with ipmiconsole or libipmiconsole?, SSIF Driver Configuration, Top
@section How do you setup Powerman with ipmipower?

There are additional details in the Powerman
(@uref{http://code.google.com/p/powerman/}) documentation, however
here are the basics.  In the powerman.conf file, you want to include
the ipmipower.dev device file, setup an ipmipower device in co-process
mode, then configure hosts to use that device.

@example
include "/etc/powerman/ipmipower.dev"

device "ipmi0" "ipmipower" "/usr/sbin/ipmipower -h mynodes[0-10] |&"

node "mynodes[0-10]"  "ipmi0" "mynodes[0-10]"
@end example

You may wish to add some additional ipmipower configuration on the
device line:

@example
device "ipmi0" "ipmipower" "/usr/sbin/ipmipower --wait-until-on --wait-until-off -h mynodes[0-10] -u username -p password |&"
@end example

although you will probably want to do some of this configuration
(especially the username and password) in freeipmi.conf.

If you use an alternate set of hostnames for IPMI from the primary
hostname, that can configured like this:

@example
device "ipmi0" "ipmipower" "/usr/sbin/ipmipower -h altname[0-10] |&"

node "primaryname[0-10]"  "ipmi0" "altname[0-10]"
@end example

Configuration can be trickier if you want to configure Powerman to use
ipmipower with an OEM extension specified through --oem-power-type.
Many OEM extensions in ipmipower must include additional arguments,
which can be passed in via the node argument.  In addition, while
ipmipower can take a host range as an additional argument, powerman
may not.

For example, the following would be suitable to configure OEM
extension support the Dell Poweredge C410x.  A specific node
identifier (i.e. mynode0-1) is used to map to a specific node and
additional argument.

@example
include "/etc/powerman/ipmipower.dev"

device "ipmi0" "ipmipower" "/usr/sbin/ipmipower -h mynodes[0-10]+[1-16] --oem-power-type=c410x -l admin |&"

node "mynodes[0-10]-1" "ipmi0" "mynodes[0-10]+1"
node "mynodes[0-10]-2" "ipmi0" "mynodes[0-10]+2"
node "mynodes[0-10]-3" "ipmi0" "mynodes[0-10]+3"

As noted in the manpage, the Dell Poweredge C410x appears to have
difficulty handling new slot power control requests until prior ones
have completed.  Users may wish to configure ipmipower with
--wait-until-on, --wait-until-off, and consider using the
ipmipower-serial.dev device file instead of ipmipower.dev.

@section How do you setup Conman with ipmiconsole or libipmiconsole?

There are additional details in the Conman
(@uref{http://conman.googlecode.com/}) documentation and manpages,
however here are some basics.

To configure Conman to connect via the ipmiconsole tool, Conman comes
with an expect script named ipmiconsole.exp, typically installed into
/usr/lib/conman/exec/ipmiconsole.exp.  Consoles can be setup by adding
lines to conman.conf like:

@example
CONSOLE name="myserver"   dev="/usr/lib/conman/exec/ipmiconsole.exp myserver myusername mypassword"
@end example

One of the useful aspects of using the ipmiconsole.exp script is that
the same configuration options you may have already configured into
freeipmi.conf, may be loaded automatically when ipmiconsole is
executed via this expect script.

However, as can be expected, scalability may be a problem as you must
launch a process for every node in your cluster.

Conman is also capable of connecting to servers natively through the
libipmiconsole library, so that no additional processes are launched.
They can be configured as follows:

@example
CONSOLE name="myserver" IPMIOPTS="U:myusername,P:mypassword" dev="ipmi:myserver"
@end example

on some older versions of Conman, you would instead use

@example
CONSOLE name="myserver" IPMIOPTS="myusername,mypassword" dev="ipmi:myserver"
@end example

Please see the Conman documentation for current version options and
additional configuration options available.

One of the additional advantages of configuring Conman to use the
libipmiconsole library natively is that Conman is able to detect and
manage additional IPMI error cases.

Scripts to monitor IPMI via FreeIPMI in Ganglia and Nagios have been
developed and are downloadable on the FreeIPMI homepage
(@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/download.html}).
Instructions for setup can be found at the top of the scripts.

@section Why is the IPMI kernel driver faster than the KCS driver?

Internally the IPMI kernel driver chooses to spin while polling for a
response from the base management controller (BMC) while the KCS
driver elects to sleep between poll attempts.  An operating system's
scheduler granularity may be larger than the time it takes to perform
a IPMI transaction, thus the wall clock time of the KCS driver is far
worse than the IPMI kernel driver.  FreeIPMI's KCS driver implements
the sleep between poll attempts because it is believed to provide
better overall system use.  To force the KCS driver to have similar
wall clock response time to the IPMI kernel driver, users can specify
the 'spinpoll' workaround.

@section Why are there so many IPMI compliance bugs? 

The IPMI specification is very large.  At last check, the IPMI
specification was 601 pages.  This does not count the various side
specifications related to IPMI, including DCMI, PET, FRU, and the
various OEM extension specifications (e.g. Intel Node Manager).  Many
sections of text can be ambiguous.  Many components of IPMI are
optional and aren't required to be implemented.  There is some leeway
for implementation interpretation as well.  Ultimately, bugs will
happen.  In all fairness, FreeIPMI has had bugs too.

A number of the IPMI compliance bugs found by FreeIPMI are documented
in the freeipmi-bugs-issues-and-workarounds.txt document (you can find
it on the website here:
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/freeipmi-bugs-issues-and-workarounds.txt}).

@section How do I get around an IPMI compliance bug on my motherboard?

Most of the FreeIPMI tools and libraries have flags to workaround a
large number of IPMI compliance bugs found on motherboards.  Please
see the appropriate tool manpages or library header files for details
on the workarounds available and for what motherboards.

If you believe there is a compliance issue on your motherboard that
has not yet been implemented, please contact the maintainers on the
@email{freeipmi-devel@@gnu.org} mailing list.

@section How do I program with the FreeIPMI libraries?

If you are looking for a high level library to do Serial-over-LAN
(SOL) or IPMI sensor/SEL monitoring, you may wish to look at the
libipmiconsole and libipmimonitoring libraries.  These libraries
attempt to abstract a large amount of the underlying IPMI detail from
developers.  The majority of the documentation can be found in the
header files.  Some examples can be found in the documentation and the
FreeIPMI tools that use them.

The libfreeipmi library is the core library used by other FreeIPMI
libraries and tools.  However, it is quite detailed in regards to the
IPMI specification and many components of the library will be quite
confusing to those unfamiliar with the finer details of the IPMI
specification.  It is recommended most use the higher level libraries
described above.

A more detailed description of the available FreeIPMI libraries can be
found in the freeipmi-libraries.txt document (you can find it on the
website here:
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/freeipmi-libraries.txt}).
