o Support ipmi-dcmi, Data Center Management Interface (often referred
  to as DCM or DCMI).
o Make output of ipmi-sel, ipmi-sensors, and ipmimonitoring easier to
  read and consistent to each other.  Under default output, sensors
  listed in ipmi-sensors and ipmimonitoring are identical.  Legacy
  output is supported through the --legacy-output option.
o Rename pef-config to ipmi-pef-config for naming consistency.
o Make output of ipmi-chassis, bmc-info, bmc-device, and info output
  of ipmi-sel, ipmi-sensors, and ipmi-pef-config consistent to
  each other.
o When querying active/inactive, allowed/unallowed, true/false,
  etc. status fields in ipmi-chassis, bmc-info, and bmc-device, output
  all fields instead of only the active/allowed/true/etc. fields.
o Support exclusion equivalent options (such as
  --exclude-sensor-types) in various tools such as ipmi-sel,
  ipmi-sensors, and ipmimonitoring.
o Support sensor unit percentages, rates, and modifiers (e.g. "%
  hit", "gigabyte per minute", "pounds / cu in") in most tools.
o Support non-abbreviated units (e.g. "Amps" instead of "A") in most
  tools.
o Output IANA Manufacturer Name when appropriate in most tools.
o Support Entity ID based sensor naming through the
  --entity-sensor-names option in many tools.
o Support OEM interpreted output through the --interpret-oem-data
  option in many tools.
o "Library-ize" much of the functionality originally only included in
  tools.
o Re-work libipmimonitoring to return sensor events for all sensors,
  not just non-threshold sensors.  Resulted in an API change.
o Removed many short options for more consistent command line
  "architecture" between tools and to ensure short options are more
  consistent between tools.  Limit short options to only the most
  popular options.  Short options have been removed from ipmipower,
  ipmiconsole, bmc-watchdog, ipmi-chassis, ipmimonitoring, ipmi-sel,
  and ipmi-raw. See details below for specific short options removed.
o Various new options and features added to most tools.
o Various minor feature enhancements.
o Various bug fixes.
o Various documentation updates.

--------------------------------------
o Global in most tools
  - Rename --no-probing option to --disable-auto-probe for consistency
    in FreeIPMI.  Backwards compatability maintained.
o Global in config tools (bmc-config, pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config)
  - More carefully check for fatal vs. non-fatal errors when
    performing configuration.  This change may result in slight
    behavior differences.  For example, a session-timeout may have
    previously been considered a non-fatal error, making the config
    tools continue on attempting more configuration activities.  Now,
    it would error out on the first session-timeout indication.
o ipmi-sensors
  - Check variety of corner cases such as whether sensor readings,
    hysteresis, thresholds, etc. are even available before reading
    them.  Some sensors may output slightly different information than
    before.  For example, suppose a power supply sensor exists for a
    power supply that is not installed.  If the sensor is enabled on
    the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would likely report "OK".  If the
    sensor is disabled on the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would now likely
    report "NA".  Previously, "OK" would have been reported under both
    conditions.
  - Output "NA" for sensors whose slave addresses are not the BMC.
  - Output "Unknown" for sensors whose readings cannot be determined.
  - Output multiple sensor status messages on separate lines, rather
    than all on one line under verbose modes.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Busy sensors are now output with "Unknown" instead of causing
    errors.
  - When fields are not relevant, do not output as much information in
    verbose and very verbose mode.  For example, don't output
    hysteresis or threshold information for power supply sensors.
  - Alter some output ordering for consistency to IPMI spec.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability under
    non-verbose output.  For example, "Fully Redundant (formerly
    "Redundancy Regained")" is now just "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmimonitoring
  - Support -v verbose option to output sensors readings that aren't
    readable.
  - Check corner case for sensor readability.  May lead to slightly
    different output in ipmimonitoring.  For example, suppose a power
    supply sensor exists for a power supply that is not installed.  If
    the sensor is enabled on the motherboard, ipmimonitoring would
    normally report "Nominal".  If the sensor is disabled on the motherboard, 
    ipmimonitoring would normally not output a sensor state (it would
    output "N/A" under verbose mode). Previously, "Nominal" would have
    been reported under both conditions.
  - Consider sensors without BMC slave addresses unreadable.  May
    result in sensors not being output like before.
  - Busy sensors may result in sensors not being output rather than
    causing errors.
  - Output "Unrecognized State" if the sensor specifies a state that is
    unrecognized.
  - Output multiple bitmask strings if multiple bits are set.
  - Output "OK", similarly to ipmi-sensors when no bitmask strings are
    returned from a sensor reading.
  - Shorten/adjust some state strings for readability.  For example,
    "Fully Redundant (formerly "Redundancy Regained")" is now just
    "Fully Redundant".
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
o ipmipower
  - Removed many early experimental features from ipmipower so
    ipmipower is more like other tools.  Removed ipmi-version,
    cipher-suite-id, privilege-level, and authentication-type auto
    discovery. Removed ability to enable/disable a number of experimental
    features.
  - Changed --config to --config-file in ipmipower for consistency to
    other tools.  Backwards compatability maintiained.
  - Replace --ipmi-version option with --driver-type.  Backwards
    compatability maintained.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmipower' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-config
  - Support configuration of UserN:Lan_Session_Limit and
    UserN:Serial_Session_Limit (where N is a user id number).
  - By default, do not output unsupported authentication type enables
    when checking out the Lan_Conf_Auth section.  Output unsupported
    authentication type enables under verbose output.
  - By default, do not output serial configuration parameters on checkout.
    Output serial configuration under verbose output.
  - Remove checkout of "Misc" section and "Power_Restore_Policy"
    field, which is now handled by ipmi-chassis-config.  Backwards
    compatability commit and diff maintained.
  - Remove case sensitivity when checking a number of fields.
o ipmi-chassis
  - Alter ipmi-chassis output to print "unknown" when field is not known.
  - Alter some ipmi-chassis output text to be more consistent to IPMI
    spec.
  - Hide configuration options now supported in ipmi-chassis-config.  
o ipmi-fru
  - Output FRU device names along with IDs in ipmi-fru.
  - Reduce excessive newline outputs in ipmi-fru.
  - Output more information by default.  Change the output of verbose
    vs. very verbose output.
o ipmi-sel
  - Change default privilege from user to operator.
  - Search of SDR records by sensor number and sensor owner id.
  - Support SEL Event Record debug dumping.
o ipmiconsole
  - Support --session-timeout and --retransmission-timeout options.
  - Removed -C short option for consistency to other tools.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmiconsole' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o bmc-watchdog
  - Remove legacy 'v' option for version.
